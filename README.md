The development server will start up at `localhost:8080`

## Build & Deploy

When you're happy with your changes...

- Commit changes to master
- Run `yarn deploy` (or `npm run deploy` if that's your thing)

This does the following:
- Runs Webpack
- Adds & commits the new build artifacts
- Pushes the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository
