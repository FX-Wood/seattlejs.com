This is what all those embroidered pillows and motivational posters told us is the best possible outcome, and we should celebrate that! But doing a job that's also a thing we do for play isn't free of risks. If we treat our jobs as a hobby, we risk doing things because they're fun for us and not because they're good for our company or team. It's great to be excited about tech and to want to play with exciting tech in our free time — but the tech we choose at work should be boring.",
