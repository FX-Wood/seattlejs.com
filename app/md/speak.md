No matter who you are and what your experience level is, you can give a talk at SeattleJS. We accept everything from 5-10 minute lightning talks to ~30 minute presentations. If you've learned something new or have some hard-won widsom to share, you'll find SeattleJS a warm and welcoming place to speak.
